# Sign-Language-Interpreter
## Overview
Sign language is an incredible advancement that brings the deaf and the dumb people close to our society. Unfortunately, some drawbacks have come along with this language. Not everyone knows how to interpret a sign language when having a conversation with a deaf and dumb person. One finds it hard to communicate without an interpreter. To solve this, we need an application which is easily available to all which converts the sign language to text in real time. The main purpose of this project is to eliminate the barrier between the deaf and the dumb and the rest.
## Methodology
Input to our application is a video recording .Our application processes the video, decodes any sign language present and interprets it with the help of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
Our application will be built on Python and Tensorflow.
